I give you the working version of Dijkstra's algorithm.
I also give you the header for the Graph class.
Your assignment is to write the function definitions for the graph class.
I gave you a couple of them in graph_base.cpp and all of the CMake files necessary

You must create a new file "graph.cpp" which holds the remianing functions from 
the graph.h declarations.
